# Introduction
This repository contains a series of presentations and Google Colaboratory notebooks which provide an introduction to machine learning and deep learning tools and techniques. The material was created for a short-course for medical researchers at Ä°stinye University. The intention of the material is to bring these researchers up to speed with basic and advanced techniques, with an emphasis on model creation and validation.
