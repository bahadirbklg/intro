# Introduction to Deep Learning for Medical Researchers
This repository contains a series of presentations, Google Colaboratory notebooks, and supporting code and provides an introduction to machine learning and deep learning tools and techniques. The material was created for a short-course for medical researchers at Ä°stinye University. The intention of this class is to introduce these researchers to basic and advanced techniques, with an emphasis on model creation and validation.

The course is split into 11 one-hour modules. Contents include:
1. Introduction
